```{r data generation, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
ell = runif(1,0.01,0.99)
z = round(qnorm(ell),2)
ell = round(pnorm(z),4)
```

Question
========
Determine the probability that the standard normal variable is less than `r z`. In other words, evaluate $P(Z < `r z`)$.


Solution
========
By using the z-table, we find the appropriate probability.
$$P(Z<`r z`)=`r ell`$$
