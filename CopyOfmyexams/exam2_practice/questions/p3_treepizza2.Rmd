```{r data generation, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
names = c("Matilda","Wilhelmina","Rosalie","Norma","Birtie","Clarissa","Claude","Delilah")

item = c("type of crust","topping","type of crust","size","sauce")
items = c("types of crust","toppings","types of crust","sizes","sauces")


while(T){
  ns = sample(2:6,2,replace=T)
  if(prod(ns) < 21){
    break
  }
}

na = sample(names,1)
i = sample(1:length(item),2)
it = item[i]
its = items[i]
```

Question
========

`r na` is buying a pizza. `r na` still has to decide on a `r it[1]` and a `r it[2]`. The shop carries `r ns[1]` `r its[1]` and `r ns[2]` `r its[2]`. How many different combinations is `r na` choosing between? Please make a **tree diagram**.


Solution
========

Make a tree.

\setkeys{Gin}{width=0.5\textwidth}

```{r tree, echo=F, fig.cap=""}
par(mar=c(0,0,0,0))
plot(1,1,type ="n",axes=F,ann=F,xlim=c(0,1),ylim=c(0,1.1))
a = ns[1]
b = prod(ns)

as = (2*(1:a)-1)/(a*2)
bs = (2*(1:b)-1)/(b*2)

for(i in 1:a){
  lines(c(0,0.5),c(0.5,as[i]))
  for(j in 1:ns[2]){
    lines(c(0.5,1),c(as[i],bs[(i-1)*ns[2]+j]))
  }
}
text(0.25,1.05,it[1])
text(0.75,1.05,it[2])
```

\setkeys{Gin}{width=1\textwidth}


Count the leaves (the nodes at the far right). In this case there are `r b` leaves.

$$\fbox{There are `r b` combinations possible.} $$
