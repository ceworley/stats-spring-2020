Question
========

`r q`

Solution
========

This scenario describes a permutations problem (order matters). We are considering the nonrepeating sequences of size `r x` from a set of size `r n`.

$$\begin{aligned}
{_nP_r} &= \frac{n!}{(n-r)!} \\ \\
n &= `r n` \\\\
r &= `r x` \\\\
{_{`r n`}P_{`r x`}} &= \frac{`r n`!}{(`r n`-`r x`)! } \\ \\
&= \frac{`r n`!}{`r n-x`!} \\ \\
&= `r sss` \\ \\
&= \fbox{`r format(ans,scientific=F)`} 
\end{aligned}$$
