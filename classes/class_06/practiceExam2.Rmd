## Q1 

An archer wants to know whether to adjust her sight. Her sight adjusts vertically and horizontally.  After many years of shooting, she has decided the two variables ($X$ and $Y$) are independent. She adjusts her sight if either variable's sample mean is significantly far from 0, where she defines significance with a two-tail $t$ test with a significance level $\alpha = 0.05$.
