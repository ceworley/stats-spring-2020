Question
========
In some situation, each trial has `r p` probability of success. There will be `r n` trials.

Answerlist
--------
* What is the probability of getting exactly `r x1` successes? In other words, determine $\text{Pr}(X = `r x1`)$.
* What is the probability of getting exactly `r x2` successes? In other words, determine $\text{Pr}(X = `r x2`)$.
* What is the probability of getting more than `r x2` successes? In other words, determine $\text{Pr}(X > `r x2`)$.
* What is the probability of getting at least `r x2` successes? In other words, determine $\text{Pr}(X \ge `r x2`)$.
* What is the probability of getting less than `r x2` successes? In other words, determine $\text{Pr}(X < `r x2`)$.
* What is the probability of getting at most `r x2` successes? In other words, determine $\text{Pr}(X \le `r x2`)$.
* Determine the mean number of successes.
* Determine the standard deviation of successes.

Solution
========

This is a binomial distribution, so use the appropriate formulas. You may need to use $$P(X=x) ~=~ _n\text{C}_x \cdot p^x(1-p)^{n-x}$$ up to 4 times... but you do not need to use it $`r n+1`$ times (which you would do to determine the entire probability distribution). You will instead need to use the compliment rule.

Answerlist
--------
* $\text{Pr}(X=`r x1`) ~=~ {_{`r n`}}C_{`r x1`}\cdot`r p`^{`r x1`} `r 1-p`^{`r n-x1`} ~=~ `r dbinom(x1,n,p)`$
* $\text{Pr}(X=`r x2`) ~=~ {_{`r n`}}C_{`r x2`}\cdot`r p`^{`r x2`} `r 1-p`^{`r n-x2`} ~=~ `r dbinom(x2,n,p)`$
* $\text{Pr}(X > `r x2`) ~=~ `r 1-pbinom(x2,n,p)`$
* $\text{Pr}(X \ge `r x2`) ~=~ `r 1-pbinom(x2-1,n,p)`$
* $\text{Pr}(X < `r x2`) ~=~ `r pbinom(x2-1,n,p)`$
* $\text{Pr}(X \le `r x2`) ~=~ `r pbinom(x2,n,p)`$
* Because this is a binomial distribution, $\mu = np$, so $\mu = `r n*p`$
* Because this is a binomial distribution, $\sigma = \sqrt{npq}$, so $\sigma = `r sqrt(n*p*(1-p))`$
