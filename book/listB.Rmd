Question
========

A random procedure generated the following sample (sequence of measurements):
$$\vec{x} = `r x`$$

Determine the smallest index $i$ such that $x_i=`r xi`$. In other words, find the index of the first occurrence of measurement `r xi`.


Solution
========


The `r thword[i]` measurement is the first occurrence of `r xi`. Thus, $i=`r i`$ is the smallest index such that $x_i=`r xi`$.


| $i$ | $x_i$ |
|:---:|:---:|
`r tbl`
