# Probability

We will use $\mathbb{P}$ to denote probability of an event. Typically, we will also describe the event in square brackets. For example, we could write "the probability that a fair coin lands tail-side-up is 1/2" as an equation.
$$\P{\text{first flip of fair coin lands tail-side-up}} ~=~ 1/2$$
Of course, it would get annoying to have that many words in our equations, so we typically abbreviate.
$$\P{T}=1/2 $$
