## Percentile

* Imagine the scores on some test are the following:
```{r scores}
set.seed(123)
x = round(rnorm(20,150,20))
```
`r x`

* A person who scored `r x[1]` is trying to quantify how well they did. Percentile is a good way to do this.
* Percentile is what percent of scores are less than or equal to a value.
* There are `r length(x)` scores. Of those, there are `r sum(x<=x[1])` scores less than or equal to `r x[1]`.
$$\ell = \frac{`r sum(x<=x[1])`}{`r length(x)`} = `r sum(x<=x[1])/length(x)` $$
* People say the `r round(sum(x<=x[1])/length(x)*100,1)`th percentile is `r x[1]`.
* I will also say the score `r x[1]` has a percentile of `r sum(x<=x[1])/length(x)`.
