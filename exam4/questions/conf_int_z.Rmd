Question
========

A scientist has weighed `r n` specimens of a newly discovered organism. Those weights have a *sample mean* of $\bar{x} =`r xbar`$ grams and a sample standard deviation of $s=`r s`$ grams. The scientist hopes to construct a 95% **confidence interval** of the organism's *population mean* ($\mu$). This is to report an interval that helps indicate the scientist's uncertainty due to only weighing `r n` specimens.

The scientist will later consult a statistician for a more precise method, but for now she will use a quick method to estimate the 95% confidence interval:
$$\bar{x}\pm \frac{2s}{\sqrt{n}} $$

Your answers will have a tolerance of 0.1 grams.

Answerlist
--------
* Determine the lower boundary of the condidence interval by using $\bar{x}-\frac{2s}{\sqrt{n}}$.
* Determine the upper boundary of the condidence interval by using $\bar{x}+\frac{2s}{\sqrt{n}}$.


Solution
========

Plug the numbers into the expressions.

Answerlist
--------
* Lower bound = $~`r xbar`-2(`r s`)/\sqrt{`r n`} ~=~ `r LB`$
* Upper bound = $~`r xbar`+2(`r s`)/\sqrt{`r n`} ~=~ `r UB`$
