## Problem of Points

* Two gamblers ($A$ and $B$) are flipping a fair coin.
* Heads gives $A$ a point; tails gives $B$ a point.
* The first gambler to get 3 points wins the $100 pot. 
* The cops come before the end: $A$ has 2 points and $B$ has 1 point.
* The gamblers escape with the pot, but lost the coin, so they are done playing.
* How should the pot be fairly split?

This problem has historical importance.

* The earliest known statement of this problem is from Luca Pacioli in **1494**.
* Luca gave the wrong answer.
* Pascal and Fermat finally got the correct answer is **1662**. In doing so, they clearly defined many concepts of probability.

## Luca's 1494 answer

* Since $A$ won 2 points and $B$ won 1 point, $A$ deserves 2/3 of the pot and $B$ deserves 1/3 of the pot.
